It distinguishes itself from traditional AI by its ability to interact with the physical world. This interaction involves several key capabilities:\n\n- **Perceives** the real world through sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units).\n- **Reasons** about physical constraints and dynamics to make informed decisions.\n- **Acts** through motors, actuators, and end-effectors to manipulate objects or move through environments.\n- **Learns** from physical interaction and feedback to improve its performance over time.\n\nPhysical AI is crucial for developing humanoid robotics, which are robots designed to operate in human environments using bipedal locomotion and human-like manipulation. These robots are intended to perform tasks in spaces typically designed for human occupation and use, making the integration of physical AI essential for their functionality and effectiveness.","citations":[{"chapter_id":"glossary","chapter_title":"Glossary","section":"Glossary > Physical AI Terms > Physical AI","relevance_score":0.825,"excerpt":"### Physical AI\nArtificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators (robots).\n"},{"chapter_id":"intro","chapter_title":"Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics","section":"Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics > What is Physical AI?","relevance_score":0.795,"excerpt":"## What is Physical AI?\n\n**Physical AI** represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems.
