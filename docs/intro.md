# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** interactive book! This hands-on guide will take you on a journey from fundamental robot middleware concepts through advanced AI-powered robotics systems.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in the digital realm, Physical AI:

- **Perceives** the real world through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs)
- **Reasons** about physical constraints and dynamics
- **Acts** through motors, actuators, and end-effectors
- **Learns** from physical interaction and feedback

This book focuses on **humanoid robotics** - robots designed to operate in human environments using bipedal locomotion and human-like manipulation.

## What You'll Learn

This book is organized into 4 progressive modules covering the complete Physical AI stack:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals (36 min)
Learn the industry-standard middleware that powers modern robots:
- ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- URDF robot description format for humanoids

### Module 2: Gazebo Simulation (24 min)
Master physics-based simulation for rapid prototyping:
- Gazebo simulation essentials
- Sensor modeling (LiDAR, cameras, IMU)
- ROS 2 integration with simulated robots

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (48 min)
Unlock photorealistic simulation and AI-powered perception:
- Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- Visual SLAM and navigation for bipedal robots

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (36 min)
Build robots that understand natural language and execute complex tasks:
- Voice-to-action with OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based cognitive planning
- Real-world case studies

## Who This Book Is For
